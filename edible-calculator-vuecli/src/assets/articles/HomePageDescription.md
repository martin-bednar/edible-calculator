### Welcome!
 This is an **online toolkit** that can **greatly improve** your cannabis cooking experience and results üë®‚Äçüç≥

There are currently two cooking tools, both **completely free**, that you can use on any device, any time:

**[Cannabis decarb time calculator](/decarb-time-calculator)**, the only tool in existence that can **calculate the ideal time of cannabis decarboxylation**.

**[Edible dosage calculator](/dosage-calculator)**, that can help you figure out the **THC content** in your **cannabis-infused edibles**. Although there are multiple calculators of this kind available on the internet, this one is the most precise.
