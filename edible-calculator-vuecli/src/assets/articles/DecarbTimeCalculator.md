About the Decarboxylation time calculator
--------------------------------

If you want to create really potent THC-infused edibles, 
then proper decarboxylation is perhaps the most crutial step
in the entire process. It can enhance the amount of THC in your product 
by more than 500%, which means that it can save four fifths of your cannabis.

The most common way of decarboxylation is by placing your ground dried cannabis into the oven
and "baking" it for a specific amount of time. That may sound easy, but if you simply
eyeball the time needed or use an inaccurate decarb chart, you can easily spoil your cannabis,
because the THC starts degenerating into other cannabinoids in a matter of minutes, if you leave
it in the oven for too long.

And that's exactly the moment when this calculator really comes in handy - 
it's based on scientific studies to provide the most accurate results available,
overpreforming the common decarb time charts by far.

### Usage guide

Simply choose the exact temperature that you'll be using for your decarb process,
and the calculator computes the time to reach maximum level of THC. Make sure to
double-check the temperature that you are working with, as just a small difference
in time or temperature can mean huge drop in THC content.

Leave the dried ground cannabis for the exact time period suggested by this app,
and you'll end up with edibles of incredible potency ðŸ”¥

### Temperature range limitations
This tool is limited to temperatures between 208 Â°F (98 Â°C) and 302 Â°F (150 Â°C),
because lower values would require more than four hours to complete the decarb process,
and higher temperature would cause the THC to evaporate, ruining the process.

### Scientific background
The computations are based mainly on this paper:
