      Hi and welcome! This is a toolkit that can greatly improve your cannabis cooking experience and results üë®‚Äçüç≥
    </p>
    <p>
      There are currently two cooking tools, both completely free, that you can use on any device, any time:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <router-link to="/decarb-time-calculator">Cannabis decarb time calculator</router-link>, the only tool in existence that can calculate the ideal time of cannabis decarboxylation.
      </li>
      <li>
        <router-link to="/dosage-calculator">Edible dosage calculator</router-link>, that can help you figure out the THC content in your cannabis-infused edibles. Although there are multiple calculators of this kind available on the internet, this one is the most precise.
      </li>
    </ul>
